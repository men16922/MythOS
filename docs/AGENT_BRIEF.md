> ▶ NEXT SESSION: **Deploy the enemy-art bundle + owner live pass**. Enemy art 20/20 is regenerated to canon (2026-07-14, `docs/plans/2026-07-13-enemy-art-consistency.md` DONE) but landed AFTER the `00060-ldj` build — owner `make deploy` (art) then verify live: telegraph 체감, enemy variety across loops, 신규 적 아트 4종 roster consistency, desktop split/quick-slots feel. `! git push` also pending (origin behind).

## Snapshot

Project MythOS is a single-player SF loop-based TRPG/CRPG on a Python 3.11+ local runtime. An AI GM (Ollama) drives scenes; tactical combat is adjudicated by a separate deterministic combat engine.

Current baseline:
- `RuntimeSessionService` handles shared orchestration for CLI/Streamlit/FastAPI.
- React+TS SPA + FastAPI `/api/v1` REST/WS adapter, and Streamlit demo all call the same runtime service.
- PostgreSQL/MinIO/OTel/Jaeger local infra (Redis removed 2026-07-04; images generate synchronously in-request).
- Neo-Seoul 01 is the primary scenario, `glass-library` is an extension sample.
- Story Bible, Codex, Run History, Meta Progression, Save/Load, Ending Resolver implemented.
- Tactical combat (full-body action pose, role/tags skill animations, icon action bar, direct party control, 3 new allies and 4 enemy types with 35 new combat sprites mapped into scenario.json), Tactical Board legend/tile inspector/learning-goal banner, Playwright E2E implemented.
- Operation map route-node-ified (deterministic DAG + multi-perspective anchors `route_map.py`/`route_runtime.py`) + session memory (`session_memory.py` beat ledger + rolling synopsis, not RAG).
- Progression unlock (archetype gates, insight investment tree, rank pips/upgrade banner, epiphany banner, Run History + Echo/Shard dashboard, cross-scenario unlock, data-driven grant).
- Persistent objective/stakes display and choice value-axis/expected-result/actual-result summary UX.
- mflux/FLUX (local) / Vertex Imagen (cloud) images generate sync in-request; Redux character consistency; MinIO/GCS asset paths verified.
- Narrative is dual-model: storyteller `OLLAMA_MODEL_STORY`=`gemma4:latest` (8B, free text) → parser `OLLAMA_MODEL_PARSER`=`qwen2.5:3b-instruct` (JSON structuring). Streaming path runs a regex parser in parallel.
- Opening sequence consistency (5 cuts: awakening→se_rin appears→approaching hand→first contact→pursuit+combat). Prompt-layer separation in progress (authored directives→`resources/<scenario>/directives/*.md`, `docs/PROMPT_LAYER.md`). Detailed state in `STATUS.md`.

## Active Work

`docs/NEXT_PLAN.md` is authoritative for next priorities.

1. **Enemy roster overhaul (`[manual]` residue)**: telegraph fix + spawn variety LIVE in `00060-ldj`; enemy art 20/20 regenerated to canon (codex, 2026-07-14) but UNDEPLOYED — next `make deploy` ships it. Remaining: owner live feel pass. Plan: `docs/plans/2026-07-13-enemy-art-consistency.md` (DONE).
2. **CBT teaser V2 (`[manual]`)**: full teaser is ASSEMBLED — `docs/cbt/v2/final/mythos_teaser_v2.mp4` (1:49, 1080p). Remaining is owner watch-through + release review (revision loop ready).
3. **Combat live sign-off**: `00060-ldj` serves the full combat overhaul + session #17-#18 (desktop split, quick-slots, EN fixes, telegraph/spawn). Owner feel-pass A-1/A-3/A-4 + telegraph/spawn live-verify is the next product gate.
4. **Maintenance/hold**: WS4 content pipeline plan-only; `glass-library` held until Neo-Seoul satisfaction (`docs/COMPLETED_SUMMARY.md` M35-M40).

## Read Order

1. Current state: `docs/STATUS.md`
2. Next work: `docs/NEXT_PLAN.md`
3. Latest log: `docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md`
4. Before structural changes: `docs/DESIGN.md`
5. Before game-rule changes: `docs/GAMEPLAY.md`
6. Before scenario changes: `docs/scenarios/*` or `resources/<scenario>/story_bible/*`

## Commands

- Basic verify: `make test`
- Python quality: `make lint`, `make typecheck`
- React quality: `make frontend-lint`, `make frontend-build`
- Browser E2E: `make test-e2e`
- Runtime smoke: `make smoke-local`
- Persistence/MinIO: `make smoke`, `make test-db`
- Full local dev: `make dev-up` / `make dev-down`

## Guardrails

- Keep runtime orchestration in `RuntimeSessionService`; do not duplicate it into UI/API.
- Keep pure unit tests Docker-free. DB tests go through `MYTHOS_RUN_DB_TESTS=1`.
- Do not treat generated outputs, `.env`, tokens, `.docker/` data as source artifacts.
- Keep current docs short; move detailed records to `bin/docs/archive/` or dated plans.
